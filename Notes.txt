- Entity Framework
	- what is Object Relational Mapper (ORM)
		- Object Relational Mapper => Translates our code into SQL commands that update our tables in the database
		- Entity Framework Features
			- Querying => allows to query our db using linq queries  
			- Change Traking => keep track of changes occurring in our entities which need to be submitted to db 
			- Saving => allows us to save the db and ef will execute insert, update and delete commands
			- Concurrency => it uses optimistic concurrency by default to protect overwriting changes made by another user 
			- Transactions => it provides automatic transaction management whilst querying or saving data
			- Caching => it also includes first level caching out of the box, so seperated querying will return data from the cach instead of hitting the db
			- Built-in conventions => like Id property name
			- Configurations => we can configure our entities and there's ways to configure these so that we can override the conventions
			- Migrations => ability to create db schema so that when we start our application or we run a particular command, we can automatically generate our db in our db server   
	- adding Entity Framework
		- Install NuGet Gallery Extensions
			- Install Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Sqlite
			- Install Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Design
		- Add Data Folder which have DataContext class and inherit from DbContext
		- configure in Startup class in ConfigureServices =>  
			services.AddDbContext<DataContext>(options =>
            {
                options.UseSqlite("Connection String");
            });
		- Add Connection String 
			- In appsettings.Development.json 
				"ConnectionStrings":{
					"DefaultConnection":"Data source=datingapp.db"
				}
			- In Startup.cs 
				services.AddDbContext<DataContext>(options =>
				{
					options.UseSqlite(_config.GetConnectionString("DefaultConnection"));
				});
		- Create Database
			- go to https://www.nuget.org/ and search for dotnet-ef
			- install dotnet-ef that matches the version of Entity Framework that installed earlier
		- Creating Migrations
			- dotnet ef migrations add InitialCreate -o Data/Migrations
			- dotnet  ef database update
	- adding custom API
		- in API folder => create class that inherit from ControllerBase
		- add these attributes [ApiController] & [Route("api/[controller]")] on the controller
		- inject DataContext in Custom Contoller Constructor
- Notes
	- appsettings.Development.json => use where we can store things that we don't mind other people seeing like ConnectionString doesn't contain any password information
	- appsettings.json => for developing our application 
	- Migrations Folder should be with name 'Migrations'
	- it's recommended to use Asynchronous code when dealing with database
	- Saving code into source control
		- Install git	https://git-scm.com/
		- git init
		- dotnet new gitignore	=> ignore folders like bin and obj that is regenerated automatically when run project
		- exclude appsetting.json => in .gitignore => write => appsetting.json
		- create repository
		- in project terminal
			- git remote add origin https://github.com//
			- git push -u origin master
