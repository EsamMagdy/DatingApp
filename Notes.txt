- Entity Framework
	- what is Object Relational Mapper (ORM)
		- Object Relational Mapper => Translates our code into SQL commands that update our tables in the database
		- Entity Framework Features
			- Querying => allows to query our db using linq queries  
			- Change Traking => keep track of changes occurring in our entities which need to be submitted to db 
			- Saving => allows us to save the db and ef will execute insert, update and delete commands
			- Concurrency => it uses optimistic concurrency by default to protect overwriting changes made by another user 
			- Transactions => it provides automatic transaction management whilst querying or saving data
			- Caching => it also includes first level caching out of the box, so seperated querying will return data from the cach instead of hitting the db
			- Built-in conventions => like Id property name
			- Configurations => we can configure our entities and there's ways to configure these so that we can override the conventions
			- Migrations => ability to create db schema so that when we start our application or we run a particular command, we can automatically generate our db in our db server   
	- adding Entity Framework
		- Install NuGet Gallery Extensions
			- Install Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer Or Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Sqlite
			- Install Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Design
		- Add Data Folder which have DataContext class and inherit from DbContext
		- configure in Startup class in ConfigureServices =>  
			services.AddDbContext<DataContext>(options =>
            {
                 options.UseSqlServer(_config.GetConnectionString("DefaultConnection")); // or => options.UseSqlite("Connection String");
            });
		- Add Connection String 
			- In appsettings.Development.json 
				"ConnectionStrings":{
					 "DefaultConnection":"server=localhost; database=OHS; Trusted_Connection=True;" // or for Sqlite "DefaultConnection":"Data source=datingapp.db"
				}
			- In Startup.cs 
				services.AddDbContext<DataContext>(options =>
				{
					options.UseSqlite(_config.GetConnectionString("DefaultConnection"));
				});
		- Create Database
			- go to https://www.nuget.org/ and search for dotnet-ef
			- install dotnet-ef that matches the version of Entity Framework that installed earlier
		- Creating Migrations
			- dotnet ef migrations add InitialCreate -o Data/Migrations
			- dotnet ef database update

- Adding custom API
	- in API folder => create class that inherit from ControllerBase
	- add these attributes [ApiController] & [Route("api/[controller]")] on the controller
	- inject DataContext in Custom Contoller Constructor

- Adding Angular App
	- Create new project
		- install node.js
		- npm install -g @angular/cli
		- ng new client
	- Adding CORS (cross origin resource sharing) support in the API
		- In API project => Startup.cs 
			- ConfigureServices => service.AddCors();	// order not important
			- Configure	=> app.UseCors(policy => policy.AllowAnyHeader().AllowAnyMethod().WithOrigins("http://localhost:4200")); // add between app.UserRouting(); and app.UseEndpoints();
	- Enable Angular https
		- In Student Assets
			- install server certificate
			- create folder in angular app 'ssl'
			- add server.key & server.crt in ssl folder
			- In angular.json => serve =>  "options": {
												"sslKey": "./ssl/server.key",
												"sslCert": "./ssl/server.crt",
												"ssl": true
											},
		- In Startup.cs => Configure => app.UseCors(policy => policy.AllowAnyHeader().AllowAnyMethod().WithOrigins("https://localhost:4200")); 
	- Authentication
		- Safe Storage Password
			- store password in clear text
			- hashing password, apply hashing algorithm 
			- password salt
		- JWT
			- Intro => https://jwt.io/introduction
			- Adding
				- Create ITokenService interface & TokenService class that implement ITokenService
				- Nuget => System.IdentityModel.Tokens.Jwt
				- in TokenService.cs
				- create UserDto.cs that return Username & Token
				- add TokenKey in appsetting.Development.json => should be is 16 or 32 character & random string 
			- Adding Authentication middleware [Authorize]
				- Nuget => Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer
				- Startup.cs
					- ConfigureServices	=> services.AddAuthentication(JwtBearerDefaults.AuthenticationScheme)
												.AddJwtBearer(options =>
												{
													options.TokenValidationParameters = new TokenValidationParameters
													{
														ValidateIssuerSigningKey = true,
														IssuerSigningKey = new SymmetricSecurityKey(Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(_config["TokenKey"])),
														ValidateIssuer = false,
														ValidateAudience = false
													};
												});
					- Configure
						-  app.UseAuthentication(); // should be after app.UseCors() and before app.UseAuthorization()
- Add AutoMapper
	- Install AutoMapper.Extensions.Microsoft.DependencyInjection
	- Create Helpers Folder that has AutoMapperProfile : Profile
		public class AutoMapperProfile : Profile
		{
			public AutoMapperProfile()
			{
			}
		}
	- In Startup.cs => ConfigureServices
		services.AddAutoMapper(typeof(AutoMapperProfiles).Assembly);
- Add Validation
	- to database => not prefer
	- to entity => not prefer
	- to DTO => it's prefer

- Debugger
	- in .vscode folder	
		- launch.json => we have two options for debugger, if we don't have launch.json file => Ctrl+Shift+P => Generate Asstes for Build and Debug
			- .NET Core Launch (web) => launch if our application was not already starting 
			- .NET Core Attach => launch to an already running process and this often times use
		- Press Ctrl+Shift+D => .NET Core Attach

- Using Data Transfer Object (DTOs)
	- when send an object from the body like { 'username':'Esam', 'password': '1234'} and method signature (string username, string password) => there is an error 
	- using when passing data in body
	- it's not prefer to return Entity like AppUser with password instead return DTOs

- Adding Identity
	- Install Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity.EntityFrameworkCore
	- Adding AppUser : IdentityUser
	- Adding AppRole : IdentityRole
	- Adding AppUserRole
	- make DataContext : IdentityDbContext
	- In Startup.cs => ConfigureServices =>
		 services.AddIdentityCore<AppUser>(opt =>
            {
                opt.Password.RequireNonAlphanumeric = false;
            })
            .AddRoles<AppRole>()
            .AddRoleManager<RoleManager<AppRole>>()
            .AddSignInManager<SignInManager<AppUser>>()
            .AddEntityFrameworkStores<DataContext>();

- Notes
	- appsettings.Development.json => use where we can store things that we don't mind other people seeing like ConnectionString doesn't contain any password information
	- appsettings.json => for developing our application 
	- Migrations Folder should be with name 'Migrations'
	- it's recommended to use Asynchronous code when dealing with database
	- Saving code into source control
		- Install git	https://git-scm.com/
		- git init
		- dotnet new gitignore	=> ignore folders like bin and obj that is regenerated automatically when run project
		- exclude appsetting.json => in .gitignore => write => appsetting.json
		- create repository
		- in project terminal
			- git remote add origin https://github.com//
			- git push -u origin master
	- It's okay to use JQuery in Angular App
		- you can add third party JavaScript Angular without any Issues 
			JQuery manipulates to the domain object model (DOM), it can add things and remove things from the DOM 
			Angular does the same but it adds its own change detection to the DOM as well 
			so it recognizes when something has been updated inside 
			if JQuery is the thing thats manipulating the DOM, then angular change detection won't work
			So if you're using something in JQuery, you're mixing it with angular code, then you may run into problems doing this
			So don't use JQuery, use something more angular
	- [ApiController] benefits are
		- when pass parameter to action we don't need to specify the parameter 
			Register([FromBody]string username) or Register([FromQuery]string username)
		- It automatically validates the parameters that we pass up to an API endpoint based on the validation  
	- When we create service like TokenService that implement ITokenService, we want to add it into our depedency injection and select it's lifetime (how long should this service be alive for after we start it) in Startup.cs => ConfigureServices
		service.AddScoped<ITokenService, TokenService>();		=> scoped to the lifetime of the HTTP request in this case and it prefer to use with HTTP request
		service.AddSingleton<ITokenService, TokenService>();	=> doesn't stop untill our application stops so it continue to use resources and not prefer to use with HTTP request
		service.AddTransient<ITokenService, TokenService>();	=> service is going to created and destroyed as soon as the method is finished and not prefer to use with HTTP request
	- Extensions Methods => Enable us to add methods existing types without creating a new derived type or modifying the original type
		- adding more coding in Configure Service in Extensions Methods => Interface => ApplicationServiceExtensions & IdentityServiceExtensions
